# DazeStack™ & DazeCloud™ Trademark Guidelines

These guidelines explain how you may use the **DazeStack** / **DazeCloud** names, logos, and other brand features (the “Trademarks”).
They protect users from confusion and protect the ecosystem.

> **Trademark rights are separate from the open-source license.**  
> Open-source permissions do not grant rights to use trademarks.

## 1) Trademark Owner

“DazeStack”, “DazeCloud”, and related brand identifiers are trademarks of:  
**Ashish Dungdung (Proprietor, Ash Digital Services)** — India  
(Ownership may later be assigned to a future incorporated entity.)

## 2) What are the Trademarks?

They include (examples):
- Word marks: **DazeStack**, **DazeCloud**
- Project names: **DazeStackWP** (and future stacks under DazeStack)
- Product/service names:
  - **DazeStack Cloud**
  - **DazeStack Cloud Pro**
  - **DazeStack Community**
  - **DazeStack Forum**
  - **DazeCloud Community**
  - **DazeCloud Forum**
  - **DazeCloud Pro**
- Logos, icons, badges, and other brand assets (if/when published)
- Domain names and social handles containing “DazeStack” or “DazeCloud”

## 3) Allowed Uses (No Permission Needed)

You may do the following **as long as it does not imply endorsement** or confuse users:

### A) Accurate, descriptive references (nominative use)
- “Works with DazeStack”
- “Built on DazeStackWP”
- “DazeStack-compatible plugin”
- “Fork of DazeStackWP”

### B) Linking
You may link to official DazeStack repositories and websites.

### C) Unmodified redistribution
If official releases/binaries are published, you may redistribute **unaltered** copies as allowed by the software license, without changing branding.

## 4) Uses That Require Permission (Email First)

You must obtain written permission to:
- Use **DazeStack** or **DazeCloud** in the name of a company, product, or hosted service
- Use logos/icons in marketing, websites, or product UIs
- Register domains, app store listings, or social handles containing “DazeStack” or “DazeCloud”
- Create merchandise (stickers, shirts, etc.) using the Trademarks

## 5) Prohibited Uses (Not Allowed)

### A) Naming a fork or derivative product “DazeStack” / “DazeCloud”
If you fork the code and distribute or host it, you must use a distinct primary name.

**Prohibited examples:**
- “DazeStack Hosting”
- “DazeStack Cloud (by <your company>)”
- “DazeCloud Pro” (if you are not the official operator)

### B) Confusing branding / implied endorsement
You may not use our Trademarks in a way that suggests:
- You are the official project
- Your service is endorsed by DazeStack/DazeCloud
- Your hosted offering is the official “Cloud/Pro/Community/Forum”

### C) Lookalike logos
You may not use confusingly similar logos, icons, or branding.

## 6) Rules for Forks, Plugins, Integrations

### Forks
- ✅ Allowed: “Fork of DazeStackWP”
- ✅ Allowed: “Based on DazeStack”
- ❌ Not allowed: Using “DazeStack” as the primary brand for your fork

Recommended naming:
> `<YourBrand> Stack (based on DazeStackWP)`

### Plugins/Integrations
- ✅ Allowed: “Plugin for DazeStackWP”
- ✅ Allowed: “DazeStack integration”
- ❌ Not allowed: “DazeStack <PluginName>” as the primary product name (unless approved)

## 7) Hosted Services (SaaS / Cloud)

Because DazeStack is designed for hosted automation workflows and dev stack services, we enforce stronger rules for hosted offerings:

If you run a public hosted service based on this code:
- You **must not** name your service “DazeStack”, “DazeStack Cloud/Pro/Community/Forum”, or “DazeCloud Pro/Community/Forum”
- You **must** use distinct branding
- You **may** say: “Powered by DazeStack” / “Built with DazeStackWP” (truthful, non-confusing)

## 8) Attribution (Recommended)

When referring to upstream:
> “DazeStackWP is an open-source project maintained by the DazeStack project.”

## 9) Reporting Trademark Misuse

Report confusing use (repo names, domains, product branding, etc.):
- Email: **legal@dazestack.com**
- Include: links/screenshots and why it is confusing.

## 10) Permission Requests

For permission requests:
- **legal@dazestack.com** / **hello@dazestack.com**
- Include: intended use, where it appears, commercial/non-commercial
