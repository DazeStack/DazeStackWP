❌ Not allowed:

- “DazeStack Community Edition”

## 7. Hosted Services + Community Platforms Policy

Because DazeStack supports hosted automation workflows, deployment stacks,
and managed services, additional restrictions apply to hosted offerings.

If you run a hosted/public service based on this software, you:

- MUST NOT brand it as “DazeStack Cloud”, “DazeStack Community”, “DazeStack Forum”, etc.
- MUST use your own distinct branding
- MAY state truthfully: “Powered by DazeStack”

This ensures users can distinguish official vs third-party services.

Only the trademark owner or authorized licensees may operate services under names such as:

- DazeStack Cloud
- DazeStack Cloud Pro
- DazeStack Community
- DazeStack Forum

These names represent the official ecosystem.
